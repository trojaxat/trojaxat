Since I moved to Cambodia in 2018 to focus full time on programming, I have been working full time as a full stack developer for [OpenPetition](https://www.openpetition.de), working in PHP. A personal programming project written in [Typescript  and incorporates the Redux library](https://github.com/trojaxat/typescript2020) is relating to politics, something I am very interested in. 

I am extremely self motivated and hard working, while bringing a positive disposition to the team. 
I am fluent in German and have been living and working in German for over 6 years.
