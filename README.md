## _About me_

Since I moved to Cambodia in 2018 to focus full time on programming, I have been working full time as a full stack developer for [OpenPetition](https://www.openpetition.de), working in PHP. My passion from programming came abruptly, and seems to keep growing over time. My current personal project is written in [Typescript  and incorporates the Redux library](https://github.com/trojaxat/typescript2020), which is something I had been interested in for quite some time. I am extremely self motivated and hard working, while bringing a positive disposition to the team. I am fluent in German and have been living and working in German for over 5 years.
